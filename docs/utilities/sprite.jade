name: 'sprite'
description: "Given a direction in which your sprites are aligned (horizontal/vertical) and an iteration, will measure the width/height of your first sprite frame and step through to the nth next one, depending on the given iteration number. Width/height must be defined for this to work (as is the case for any sprite)"
params:
  iteration: 'Integer, the frame number on the sprite. Will be 1/X of the total image width. Zero-indexed, so the first frame is 0.'
  orientation: "Whether your sprite frames are aligned horizontal or vertical. Default is 'vertical'."
examples:
  - code: ".sprite\n  sprite: 0"
    el: "<div class='sprite'></div>"
  - code: ".sprite\n  sprite: 1 'horizontal'"
    el: "<div class='sprite2'></div>"
